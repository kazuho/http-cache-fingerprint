                     Cache fingerprinting for HTTP
               draft-kazuho-http-cache-fingerprint-latest

Abstract

   This memo introduces HTTP headers for cache fingerprinting.

   The fingerprint can be used by the server to determine the responses
   it should pre-emptively send (or "push") to client.

1.  Introduction

   Server push introduced in HTTP/2 [RFC7540] allows a server to
   speculatively send data to a client that the server anticipates the
   client will need.  For example, when receiving a request for an HTML
   document over a high-latency network, a server might want to send to
   the client resources that are required for rendering the HTML
   document (e.g. style-sheets and script files) in addition to the HTML
   itself in order to reduce the number of round-trips necessary for the
   client gathering all necessary responses.

   But in case the client is already in posession of such additional
   resources, there is no reason to push them to the client; doing so is
   just waste of bandwidth and time.

   Therefore, it is desirable to define a method for endpoints to
   communicate the cache state of a client, so that a server can
   determine what it should push with knowledge of the peer's cache
   state.  This document specifies a set of HTTP headers that can be
   used for such purpose.

   By using the headers it is possible for a server to make a good guess
   of what is already cached on a client, and only push the responses
   that have not yet been cached.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  The Cache-Fingerprint-Key Header Field

   The "Cache-Fingerprint-Key" HTTP response header field describes the
   fingerprint key of the content as a decimal number between zero (0)
   and 4294967295.

   Cache-Fingerprint-Key = 1*DIGIT

   An example is

   Cache-Fingerprint-Key: 12345

   A server MAY send the header field in a cacheable response.

   This document does not specify how the key should be derived.  In one
   form, a server MAY use a portion of a hash of the URL concatenated
   with the value of ETag response header as the key.  In another form,
   a server MAY pre-assign a small number to every resource it might
   push.

   Additional considerations in making effective use of the header is
   described in Section 4.

3.  The Cache-Fingerprint Header Field

   A user agent sends an aggregation of fingerprint keys found in cached
   responses sent from the origin server using the "Cache-Fingerprint"
   header.

   Cache-Fingerprint: *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_") *"="

   A user agent SHOULD send the header even if no response with
   fingerprint keys are being cached, as an indication to the server
   that it is capable of collecting and sending a cache fingerprint.

   When a user agent sends a "Cache-Fingerprint" header field, the value
   MUST be computed using the following steps.

   1.   collect the values of "Cache-Fingerprint-Key" header fields in
        the cached HTTP responses sent from the origin server to which
        the header field is going to be sent

   2.   if number of collected keys is zero (0), go to step 9

   3.   algebraically sort the collected keys

   4.   determine the parameter of Golomb-Rice coding to be used
        [Golomb].[Rice].  The value MUST be a power of two (2), between
        one (1) to 2147483648.

   5.   calculate log2 of the parameter determined in step 4 as a 5-bit
        value

   6.   encode the first key using Golomb-Rice coding with parameter
        determined in step 4

   7.   if number of collected keys is one (1), go to step 9

   8.   for every collected key expect for the first key, encode the
        delta from the previous key minus one (1) using Golom-Rice
        coding with parameter determined in step 4

   9.   concatenate the result of step 4, 6, 8

   10.  if number of bits contained in the result of step 9 is not a
        multiple of eight (8), append a bit set until the length becomes
        a multiple of eight (8)

   11.  encode the result of step 10 using base64url [RFC4648].  Padding
        of base64url MAY be omitted.

   As an example, when none of the cached responses from the origin
   server contained a "Cache-Fingerprint-Key" header, then the "Cache-
   Fingerprint" header field will be:

   Cache-Fingerprint:

   Or if two cached responses contained the header with values 115 and
   923, the header field will be as follows, if 512 was selected as the
   parameter for Golom-Rice coding and if padding of base64url was
   omitted.

   Cache-Fingerprint: Qc+J/w

   User agents MAY run the steps more than once with different values
   selected as the parameter used for Golomb-Rice coding, and send the
   shortest output as the value of the header.  Or it MAY use the result
   of the following equation rounded to the nearest power of two (2).
   It can be shown that the parameter chosen using this equation will
   yield the shortest output when the keys are distributed
   geometrically.

   log2(maximum_value_of_collected_keys / number_of_collected_keys)

   An implementation of the steps above can be found at https://
   github.com/kazuho/golombset/.

4.  Considerations

   Length of "Cache-Fingerprint" header field is proportional to the
   number of keys contained, and to log2 of the average distance between
   the keys.

   Therefore, to avoid "Cache-Fingerprint" header field from becoming
   too long, a server SHOULD send "Cache-Fingerprint-Key" header only
   with a response containing a resource the server needs to track the
   cache state of.

   And in case of using a hash function for deriving the value of
   "Cache-Fingerprint-Key" header, the hash value SHOULD be truncated to
   a small range of consecutive integers starting from zero (0) to a
   maximum calculated as the number of resources need to be tracked
   divided by the false positive probability.

   For example, to track the cache state of 100 resources with
   probability of 1% false positive using a hash function, the key
   SHOULD be a remainder of the hashed value divided by 10000.  Using
   the existing implementation, it is estimated that the length of
   "Cache-Fingerprint" header field will be around 136 bytes when all
   the 100 resources are cached.
